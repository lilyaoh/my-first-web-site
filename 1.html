  <p>The first step to start saving money is figuring out how much you spend. Keep track of all your expenses
    —that means every coffee, household item and cash tip as well as regular monthly bills.
    Record your expenses however is easiest for you—a pencil and paper,
    <u>a simple spreadsheet</u> or a free online spending tracker or app. Once you have your data,
    organize the numbers by categories, such as gas, groceries and mortgage, and total each amount.
    Use your credit card and bank statements to make sure you’ve included everything.</p>
