  <p>Now that you know what you spend in a month, you can begin to <u>create a budget.</u>
    Your budget should show what your expenses are relative to your income,
    so that you can plan your spending and limit overspending.
    Be sure to factor in expenses that occur regularly but not every month, such as car maintenance.
    Include a savings category in your budget and aim to save an amount that initially feels comfortable to you.
    Plan on eventually increasing your savings by up to 15 to 20 percent of your income.</p>
