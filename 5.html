  <p>After your expenses and income, your goals are likely to have the biggest impact on how you allocate your savings. For example, if you know you’re going to need to replace your car in the near future, you could start putting away money for one now. But be sure to remember long-term goals—it’s important that planning for retirement doesn’t take a back seat to shorter-term needs.
    Learning <u>how to prioritize your savings goals can give you a clear idea of how to allocate your savings.</u></p>
